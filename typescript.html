What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It's like JavaScript with super powers. 

let's check out what these powers are: 

1. You can compile your code and end up with plain js: tsc greeter.ts

2. Type annotations
    function greeter(person: string) {
        return "Hello, " + person;
    }

3. Interfaces 
    interface Person {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    }

4. Classes
    class Student {
        fullName: string;
        constructor(public firstName: string, public middleInitial: string, public lastName: string) {
            this.fullName = firstName + " " + middleInitial + " " + lastName;
        }
    }
